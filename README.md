InternPe Python Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my 4-week internship at InternPe. During this internship, I worked on developing GUI-based applications and game projects using Python and Tkinter. These projects helped me strengthen my programming fundamentals, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

Week 1 – Digital Clock  
Developed a real-time digital clock application using Python and Tkinter.  
The application displays the current system time and updates every second dynamically.

Week 2 – Tic Tac Toe  
Designed and implemented a two-player Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface.  
The program includes player turn handling, win detection logic, draw detection, and reset functionality.

Week 3 – Snake Game  
Built a classic Snake Game with keyboard controls, food generation, score tracking, and collision detection.  
This project enhanced my understanding of game loops and real-time event handling.

Week 4 – Connect 4  
Implemented a Connect 4 board game using Tkinter.  
The application checks for winning combinations across rows, columns, and diagonals, with an interactive GUI.

Technologies Used:
* Python  
* Tkinter  
* GUI Development  
* Game Logic Implementation
